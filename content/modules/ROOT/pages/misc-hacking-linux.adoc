= Capture the Flag

* A CTF challenge: Web hacking a running container on OpenShift
* There are three flags found during the journey.

== The CTF challenge

This vulnerable web application is intentionally designed with minimal interaction but contains flaws that can be exploited through SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. There are three hidden flags to discover.

Have fun exploring!

== Source and image

The challenge app is from the https://github.com/jeremychoi/CTF-web-to-system-01[CTF-web-to-system-01] repository. The procedure below deploys the pre-built container image `quay.io/jechoisec/ctf-web-to-system-01` (port 9090) to OpenShift and exposes it via a Route so you can access it in your browser.

== Getting access

Start by deploying the vulnerable container to your OpenShift cluster and exposing it with a Route so you can access it from your browser.

*Procedure*

. Ensure you are logged into your OpenShift cluster and create a project for the CTF (or use an existing project):

[source,sh,role=execute]
----
oc new-project ctf-web-to-system
oc project ctf-web-to-system
----

. Apply the CTF manifest (deployment and service). Set `$TUTORIAL_HOME` to your `demo-applications` repo path, or use the full path to the manifest file:

[source,sh,role=execute]
----
oc apply -f $TUTORIAL_HOME/k8s-deployment-manifests/ctf-web-to-system/ctf-w2s.yml --namespace=ctf-web-to-system
----

[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
service/ctf-web-to-system-service unchanged
deployment.apps/ctf-web-to-system configured
----

. Wait for the deployment to be ready (pod running and passing the readiness probe):

[source,sh,role=execute]
----
oc wait --for=condition=available deployment/ctf-web-to-system -n ctf-web-to-system --timeout=120s
----

. Expose the service with an OpenShift Route so it is reachable outside the cluster. Use `--port=80` so the Route targets the service port that forwards to the app on 9090. The first command creates the Route if it does not exist; the second prints the full URL:

[source,sh,role=execute]
----
oc expose svc ctf-web-to-system-service -n ctf-web-to-system --port=80 2>/dev/null || true
oc get route ctf-web-to-system-service -n ctf-web-to-system -o jsonpath='https://{.spec.host}{"\n"}'
----

. Open the URL shown (or run the next command to print it again):

[source,sh,role=execute]
----
oc get route ctf-web-to-system-service -n ctf-web-to-system -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}'
echo
----

IMPORTANT: Use the OpenShift Route URL (the hostname from the command above, e.g. `ctf-web-to-system-service-ctf-web-to-system.<apps-domain>`) in your browser to access the vulnerable container. Use `https://` if your cluster uses TLS for routes.

== If the app is not accessible

If the Route URL returns an error (503, connection refused, or does not load):

. Check that the pod is running and ready:
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
oc get pods -n ctf-web-to-system -l app=ctf-web-to-system
----
+
The pod should show `Running` and `1/1` ready. If it is `Pending`, `CrashLoopBackOff`, or `ImagePullBackOff`, continue to the next step.

. Inspect the pod and deployment events (image pull errors, crash reasons):
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
oc describe pod -l app=ctf-web-to-system -n ctf-web-to-system
oc get events -n ctf-web-to-system --sort-by='.lastTimestamp'
----
+
If the image `quay.io/jechoisec/ctf-web-to-system-01` cannot be pulled (e.g. not found or rate limited), you can build and push your own image from the https://github.com/jeremychoi/CTF-web-to-system-01[CTF-web-to-system-01] repository and update the deployment to use your image.

. Confirm the Route exists and points to the service:
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
oc get route ctf-web-to-system-service -n ctf-web-to-system
oc get svc ctf-web-to-system-service -n ctf-web-to-system
----
+
The service port should be 80 (forwarding to pod port 9090). If the Route was created earlier without `--port=80`, delete it and recreate: `oc delete route ctf-web-to-system-service -n ctf-web-to-system`, then run the expose command again with `--port=80`.
