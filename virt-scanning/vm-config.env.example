# RHEL VM Configuration
# Copy this file to vm-config.env and fill in your credentials

# Red Hat Subscription Credentials (REQUIRED for package installation)
# Option 1: Username/Password
RH_USERNAME="your-username"
RH_PASSWORD="your-password"

# Option 2: Organization ID + Activation Key (alternative to username/password)
# RH_ORG_ID="your-org-id"
# RH_ACTIVATION_KEY="your-activation-key"

# Set to "true" to install packages during VM deployment
INSTALL_PACKAGES="true"

# Set to "false" to skip subscription registration (VMs will have no packages)
# INSTALL_PACKAGES="false"

#================================================================
# Notes:
#================================================================
# - If INSTALL_PACKAGES="false", VMs will appear in RHACS with no vulnerability data
# - If INSTALL_PACKAGES="true" but credentials are missing, package installation will fail
# - Credentials are embedded in cloud-init secrets (stored in OpenShift)
# - VMs will auto-register and install packages during first boot (~5-10 minutes)
